# Version controlled history of Minecraft's generated assets
This repository runs a workflow every 12 hours to check for a new version and generate new assets for the latest version. New versions are tagged and pushed to the repository.

## Disclaimer
This repository is working under the assumption that, because they intentionally provide a public API for downloading the `client.jar`, Mojang does not have anything against the resulting generated assets existing somewhere on the internet for public consumption. If ever this assumption is contradicted, the repository will be promptly removed.
